📺 **YouTube Data Analysis** 🚀

## 📌 Project Description
YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing platform, and understanding what makes a video popular is key to content success. This project analyzes the top 1000 most popular YouTube videos to uncover trends, engagement metrics, and content performance. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to understand the factors that contribute to video virality and audience engagement.

### 🌟 Key Analyses:
🎯 Identify the most popular video categories based on views and engagement.

📊 Analyze trends in video duration, likes, comments, and shares.

📈 Explore correlations between engagement metrics and video success.

🎨 Provide interactive visual insights for better interpretation of data.

By using data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to extract meaningful patterns that can help content creators optimize their strategies.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset (`Most popular 1000 Youtube videos.csv`) contains key metadata of the most popular YouTube videos. 

🔍 **Key Features:**

🎬 **Video Title**: Name of the YouTube video.
📺 **Channel Name**: The creator or channel that uploaded the video.
👀 **Views**: Total number of views the video has received.
👍 **Likes & Comments**: Audience engagement indicators.
🏷️ **Category**: The type of content (e.g., Music, Gaming, Education).
